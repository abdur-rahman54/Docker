# Docker

it's a kind of training course for beginners. I am trying to demonstrate some basic of Docker so that beginners can understand easily.

Since docker is free new developer can use it comfortability.
Developer doesn't need to recreate same environment to run, so it's very fast to run same project on other platform.
